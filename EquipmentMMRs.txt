If the temperature limit of a tempering device channel is exceeded: The Procan ALPHA 4 triggers an over-temperature alarm. The system automatically stops heating to prevent damage. A cooling phase may be initiated if an active cooling system is in place. Production may be halted until the issue is resolved. This ensures safety and prevents thermal damage to the mold or materials.
To properly level the BOY 35 EVV during installation, follow these steps: Place the machine on a solid, vibration-free foundation to ensure stability. Use a precision leveling instrument (e.g., a machinist’s level) on the machine base. Adjust the leveling feet by tightening or loosening them until the machine is even in both X (left-right) and Y (front-back) axes. Verify alignment by checking platen parallelism with a dial indicator. Re-check after running test cycles to account for any settling. Proper leveling ensures smooth operation, prevents premature wear, and maintains consistent part quality.
Before filling the hydraulic fluid, perform the following checks: Ensure the machine is powered off and depressurized to prevent accidental fluid movement. Verify that the hydraulic reservoir is clean and free of contaminants. Use the correct hydraulic fluid grade as specified in the BOY 35 EVV manual. Slowly fill the reservoir while monitoring fluid level indicators. Bleed the hydraulic system by operating the pump at low speed to remove air bubbles. Check for leaks in hoses and connections. These steps prevent contamination and ensure proper hydraulic function.
To protect the Y06T water valve: Use a fine mesh filter in the cooling circuit to prevent debris from clogging the valve. Regularly inspect and clean the valve to maintain smooth operation. Ensure correct water pressure and temperature to avoid excessive stress. Shut off cooling water supply when the machine is not in use for extended periods to prevent scale buildup. Proper maintenance extends the valve’s lifespan and ensures consistent cooling performance.
Before installing a new plasticizing unit, follow these steps: Ensure the old unit is removed safely, following shut-down procedures. Clean the mounting area to remove residue or contamination. Inspect the new plasticizing unit for damage or wear. Apply heat-resistant lubricant to sliding and sealing areas. Align the unit carefully to prevent misalignment. Tighten mounting bolts in a crisscross pattern to ensure even clamping force. Heat up the unit slowly before processing material. This ensures proper installation and prevents premature wear.
The BOY 35 EVV is designed to process a variety of thermoplastics, including: Polyethylene (PE) & Polypropylene (PP) – General-purpose plastics. Polycarbonate (PC) & Polyamide (PA) – High-temperature applications. Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) – Tough, impact-resistant parts. Polyoxymethylene (POM) – Precision components. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) – High-performance engineering plastic. Proper temperature and screw design must be selected for each material.
The BOY 35 EVV plasticizing unit has three main temperature control zones: Feed zone – Preheats plastic entering the barrel. Compression zone – Controls material melting. Metering zone – Finalizes melt temperature before injection. Temperature is regulated using heating bands and thermocouples, which provide precise temperature adjustments through the Procan ALPHA 4 control system.
Standard heating tapes: 180–280°C (suitable for general-purpose plastics). High-performance heating tapes: 250–400°C (for engineering-grade plastics like PC, PA, and PEEK). Selecting the right range ensures optimal plasticization and prevents degradation.
The Procan ALPHA 4 displays temperature information via: Real-time readouts on the main control screen. Color-coded status indicators for each heating zone. Graphical trend curves to monitor stability over time. Alarm notifications for deviations beyond set tolerances. This allows for precise temperature management.
The manual states that the feed throat should be kept at a controlled temperature to: Prevent premature melting and screw jamming. Ensure consistent material flow into the plasticizing unit. Use cooling if necessary to regulate feed throat temperature. Proper feed throat monitoring prevents feeding issues and material degradation.
For materials like PC and PA, the BOY 35 EVV uses: Mold heating units to maintain mold temperatures above 100–150°C. Precision temperature sensors to monitor consistency. Slow cooling cycles to reduce internal stresses. This prevents defects and ensures material strength.
If a heating zone is too low, it causes: Incomplete plasticization, leading to unmelted material. Poor surface quality due to inconsistent melt flow. Higher injection pressure, which can cause defects. Maintaining the correct temperature range ensures uniform melting.
Use high temperatures (280–320°C) to ensure proper melting. Avoid moisture—pre-dry PC before processing. Use a corrosion-resistant screw due to PC’s high processing demands.
Purge the old material completely before removal. Cool the barrel gradually before disassembly. Install the new barrel, ensuring compatibility with the processing material. Heat up gradually before introducing the new material. This prevents cross-contamination and thermal shock.
Wear can be minimized by: Using the correct screw design for the material. Reducing excessive back pressure to lower stress. Processing at recommended temperatures to avoid degradation. Using wear-resistant coatings for abrasive materials. Wear is caused by high friction, abrasive fillers, and overheating.
Low-viscosity materials (e.g., PP, PE) may drip excessively from open nozzles. High-viscosity materials (e.g., PC, PA) require higher injection pressures and benefit from controlled flow nozzles. Selecting the right nozzle type prevents stringing, drooling, and pressure loss.
The BC (Bore-Controlled) nozzle is designed for medium- to high-viscosity plastics that require controlled flow. Best-suited materials include: Polycarbonate (PC) Polyamide (PA) (Nylon) Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) Polystyrene (PS) Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE) These materials benefit from precise melt flow control and reduced stringing or drooling.
Reinforced materials, such as glass fiber-filled plastics, require special considerations: Increased wear resistance – Use hardened screws and barrels to prevent excessive abrasion. Higher processing temperatures – Some reinforced materials require 250–320°C for proper melt flow. Increased injection pressure – Adjust machine settings to compensate for higher viscosity. Mold wear – Use hardened steel molds to prevent premature erosion. Failure to account for these factors can lead to machine damage and inconsistent part quality.
Specific clamping pressures can be found in: The Procan ALPHA 4 control system under the clamping force settings menu. The machine’s technical manual in the section detailing clamping force recommendations. Material datasheets provided by resin manufacturers, which specify the necessary clamping force for avoiding flash.
The nozzle selection depends on: Material viscosity – High-viscosity materials (e.g., PC, PA) require wider-diameter nozzles, while low-viscosity materials (e.g., PP, PE) may work better with a narrower, controlled-flow nozzle. Reinforcement content – Glass-filled materials require wear-resistant, hardened nozzles. Dripping sensitivity – Some materials (e.g., TPU, TPE) require a shut-off nozzle to prevent drooling.
The shot weight can be entered in the Procan ALPHA 4 control system under: Injection settings menu → Shot weight input field. Material calibration screen, where weight is adjusted based on resin density.
Screw retraction force: Controls the back pressure, which affects melt homogenization and resin density. Nozzle pressure force: Adjusted for material viscosity—high-viscosity materials need higher nozzle pressure to ensure smooth flow. Nozzle stroke: Ensures proper sealing against the sprue bushing—critical for materials prone to drooling or stringing.
The maximum shot weight is influenced by material density because: Lower-density materials (e.g., PP, PE) allow for higher shot weights due to their lighter mass. Higher-density materials (e.g., POM, PC, PEEK) have lower shot weights because the same volume weighs more. The machine’s maximum volumetric capacity should be checked against the material’s specific gravity to determine the correct shot weight.
Wear is classified into: Abrasive wear – Caused by glass-filled and mineral-filled plastics (e.g., GF-PA, GF-PP). Adhesive wear – Occurs with sticky polymers like PVC, TPU, which cause material build-up. Corrosive wear – Seen in acidic materials like PVC and fluoropolymers that degrade metal surfaces. Selecting hardened screws and barrels reduces wear for aggressive materials.
Use proper ventilation to remove toxic fumes (e.g., PVC, PTFE). Wear PPE (respirator, gloves, and safety goggles). Maintain proper processing temperatures to prevent decomposition of heat-sensitive plastics. Check for corrosion in machine components after prolonged exposure.
Hard water causes: Scale buildup in cooling channels, reducing efficiency. Increased maintenance costs due to frequent cleaning. To maintain water quality: Use demineralized or treated water. Install a filtration system. Periodically clean cooling circuits with descaling agents.
Recommended hydraulic fluids include: ISO VG 46 or ISO VG 68 hydraulic oils. Anti-wear additives to extend pump life. Good thermal stability to prevent degradation under heat. Proper hydraulic fluid selection reduces wear and ensures smooth operation.
Purge existing material at processing temperature. Introduce cleaning granulate (e.g., ASACLEAN, ULTRA PLAST). Run the screw at low speed to remove contaminants. Flush with the next production material before starting production. Using high-quality purging compounds prevents cross-contamination.
Thin-walled parts need high injection speeds. Reinforced materials require hardened steel molds. Venting is crucial for materials prone to gas buildup (ABS, PC). Hot runner molds are better for high-flow materials. Mold design directly impacts cycle time, part quality, and material selection.
Excessive wear on the plasticizing unit. Mold damage due to improper clamping force. Part defects like warping, sink marks, or flash. Reduced machine efficiency and increased downtime. Using the correct mold and material ensures optimal performance.
Chemical compatibility – Avoid corrosive materials like PVC without proper precautions. Abrasive properties – Glass-filled plastics require hardened components. Thermal stability – Some plastics decompose if overheated, releasing toxic gases. Processing conditions – Ensure materials match the machine’s temperature and pressure capabilities. Proper selection prevents accidents, extends machine life, and ensures product quality.
Screw speed and torque settings depend on material viscosity and thermal stability. Recommended values: Low-viscosity plastics (PP, PE, PS) → 80–150 rpm, low torque. Medium-viscosity plastics (ABS, PMMA, SAN) → 50–100 rpm, moderate torque. High-viscosity plastics (PC, POM, PA, PEEK) → 20–50 rpm, high torque. Glass-reinforced materials (GF-PA, GF-PP, GF-PC) → 15–40 rpm, very high torque (adjusted for wear reduction). Key rule: Higher viscosity = lower screw speed to prevent degradation.
Cooling settings vary depending on thermal conductivity and required mold temperature: PP, PE, PS → Cooling 10-20°C, short cooling time. ABS, PMMA, SAN → Cooling 20-30°C, moderate cooling time. PA, POM, PC → Cooling 30-80°C, longer cooling time. High-performance materials (PEEK, PSU) → Cooling 100-150°C, controlled temperature regulation to prevent internal stress. Key rule: More crystalline structure = higher cooling temperature to avoid shrinkage issues.
Material data sheets specify: Decomposition temperature – The point where material starts breaking down. Hazardous gas emissions – PVC releases hydrochloric acid (HCl); fluoropolymers release HF gas. Ventilation requirements – Ensures safe operator conditions. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) recommendations.
Formula:Max shot weight=Screw volume(cm3)×Material density(g/cm3)\text{Max shot weight} = \text{Screw volume} (cm³) \times \text{Material density} (g/cm³)Max shot weight=Screw volume(cm3)×Material density(g/cm3) Example: If the BOY 35 EVV screw volume is 100 cm³, and you use ABS (density = 1.04 g/cm³): 100×1.04=104g (maximum shot weight for ABS)100 \times 1.04 = 104g \text{ (maximum shot weight for ABS)}100×1.04=104g (maximum shot weight for ABS) Key rule: Higher density = lower shot weight capability.
Corrosive properties – Some flame retardants (halogen-based) can corrode machine parts. Processing temperature control – Too high = decomposition, too low = poor flow. Ventilation – Prevents buildup of hazardous gases. Screw material – Use corrosion-resistant alloy screws.
Analysis frequency: Every 3,000–5,000 machine hours or once per year. Specifications: Viscosity within tolerance (ISO VG 46 or 68). Low contamination (ISO 4406 standard: ≤ 19/16/13). Water content < 0.1% to avoid emulsification. No oxidation or sludge formation.
Proper predrying prevents moisture-related defects (bubbles, surface defects): SAN: 80–90°C for 2–4 hours. ABS: 80–90°C for 3–4 hours. PMMA: 80–85°C for 3–4 hours. High-humidity areas → Use desiccant dryers instead of hot-air dryers.
Low-viscosity materials (PP, PE, PS) → Use low back pressure (10-20 bar) to avoid over-shearing. Medium-viscosity materials (ABS, PMMA, POM) → Use moderate back pressure (20-50 bar) for uniform melt. High-viscosity materials (PC, PA, PEEK) → Use higher back pressure (50-100 bar) to ensure homogeneous melting. Key rule: Higher viscosity = higher back pressure for consistent melt quality.
NV (Needle Valve Nozzle) – Prevents stringing, used for low-viscosity materials (PP, PE, PS). AC (Axial Closing Nozzle) – For fast-cooling resins like POM, PA. BC (Bore-Controlled Nozzle) – For high-viscosity materials like PC, ABS, PEEK. O (Open Nozzle) – Best for general-purpose materials. VK (Valve-Controlled Nozzle) – For reinforced plastics (GF-PP, GF-PA).
Low melting point plastics (PE, PP, PS) → 160–230°C. Medium melting point plastics (ABS, PMMA, POM) → 220–260°C. High melting point plastics (PC, PA, PEEK) → 280–400°C.
PP, PE – Burns with blue flame, candle smell. ABS – Black smoke, rubber smell. PC – Drips but self-extinguishes, sweet smell. PA (Nylon) – Melts before burning, fishy smell.
Glass-filled plastics – High wear → Use hardened barrels/screws. PVC & Fluoropolymers – Corrosive → Use corrosion-resistant alloys. High-viscosity resins – Increase screw wear due to high back pressure.
Glass fiber – Causes severe abrasive wear. Mineral fillers (talc, mica) – Moderate wear. Flame retardants – Corrosive wear. Lubricated fillers (PTFE) – Reduce wear.
ABS, PMMA → Use low mold temperature (40-60°C). PA, PC → Require high mold temperature (80-120°C). Crystalline materials (POM, PEEK) → Require precise mold temperature control to avoid warpage.
Low thermal conductivity (PC, PMMA) → Longer cooling time. High thermal conductivity (PP, PE) → Faster cooling, shorter cycles. Glass-filled materials retain more heat, increasing cooling time. Key rule: Better thermal conductivity = faster cooling, lower cycle time.
The mold temperature is critical for part quality, shrinkage control, and cycle time efficiency. Recommended settings: Material Mold Temperature (°C) Polypropylene (PP) 10–30°C Polyethylene (PE) 10–40°C Polystyrene (PS) 30–50°C Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) 40–80°C Polycarbonate (PC) 80–120°C Polyamide (PA, Nylon) 80–140°C Polyoxymethylene (POM) 70–100°C Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) 120–160°C Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) 150–200°C Key Rule: Higher crystallinity requires higher mold temperature to avoid defects like warping.
Shrinkage rate impacts: Mold cavity sizing → Larger cavities are needed for high-shrinkage materials (e.g., PP, PE). Cooling time → High-shrinkage materials need longer cooling to stabilize dimensions. Processing temperature → Too high = excessive shrinkage, too low = internal stress. Gate design → Large shrinkage requires larger gates to ensure consistent packing. Example: PP shrinks 1.5–2.5%, while ABS shrinks 0.4–0.7%, requiring different mold adjustments.
Materials like PVC, POM, and PC degrade if exposed to excessive shear heat. To prevent this: Lower screw speed (20-50 rpm) to reduce friction. Optimize back pressure to minimize internal heat. Use free-flow nozzles to prevent material degradation. Monitor residence time—avoid prolonged heating in the barrel. Key Rule: Too much shear = material breakdown = bad part quality.
Hygroscopic materials (moisture-absorbing) like PA, PC, PET, ABS require predrying to prevent defects like bubbles, splay, and brittleness. Material Predrying Temp (°C) Drying Time (hrs) ABS 80–90°C 3–4 PA (Nylon) 80–110°C 4–6 PC 120–130°C 3–6 PET 140–160°C 4–6 Processing impact: If material is too wet → Poor surface finish, bubbles, weak parts. Use desiccant dryers for materials with high moisture sensitivity.
Issues with regrind material: Inconsistent melt flow → Can lead to dimensional variations. Degraded polymer chains → Reduces part strength. Contamination risk → Impurities can cause defects. Solutions: Limit regrind percentage (10–30% max, depending on material). Ensure proper filtration to remove contaminants. Mix fresh and regrind material evenly for consistency.
Some materials corrode or damage machine parts: PVC, Fluoropolymers (PTFE) → Release corrosive gases → Use stainless steel barrels & screws. Acidic flame retardants (Halogen-based) → Attack copper-based components. Cleaning agents → Avoid solvents incompatible with machine seals & coatings. Key Rule: Match component materials with the processing plastic's chemical properties.
The manual defines "wear-resistant plasticizing units" as specially designed screws, barrels, and nozzles made from hardened steel or coated alloys to handle: Glass-filled materials (GF-PA, GF-PC). Mineral-filled compounds. Abrasive pigments and additives. Common materials used for wear resistance: Bimetallic barrels with tungsten carbide coating. Nitrided or hardened screws for abrasion protection.
The manual specifies the maximum cooling water pressure to ensure safe and efficient mold temperature control. Typical Max Pressure: 6–10 bar (87–145 psi). Too high pressure → Risk of leaks and mold damage. Too low pressure → Inefficient cooling and longer cycle times. Solution: Install pressure regulators to maintain stable cooling performance.
Thermosets and elastomers behave differently compared to thermoplastics: Property Thermoplastics (PP, PE, PC, ABS) Thermosets (Bakelite, Epoxy) Elastomers (TPU, Silicone) Processing Temp Melt & cool Chemical curing Cross-linking process Recyclability Re-meltable Irreversible Limited Mold Design Standard cooling Requires heated molds Requires venting Ejection Solidifies in mold Hardens permanently Flexible removal Processing Differences: Thermosets require curing time in a heated mold (~150–200°C). Elastomers require venting to release trapped air during molding. Nozzles must prevent premature cross-linking in the barrel. Key Rule: Once a thermoset is cured, it cannot be re-melted!

Operators should be trained in machine operation, safety, and troubleshooting, including: Machine Startup & Shutdown Procedures Material Loading & Positioning Heating Zone Adjustment & Monitoring Vacuum & Pressure Forming Settings Mold Change Procedures Safety Protocols (Emergency Stop, PPE Use) Routine Maintenance (Cleaning, Lubrication, Inspection) Troubleshooting Common Issues (Misalignment, Heat Distribution, Vacuum Leaks)
When the HMI (Human Machine Interface) starts, the Startup Screen is displayed. This screen provides initial system information, machine status, and options to proceed to operational controls.
The Startup Screen presents the following two options: Manual Mode – Allows the operator to control individual machine functions manually. Automatic Mode – Runs pre-programmed forming sequences for full automation. These options allow operators to select how they want to operate the machine.
To access the Main Menu Screen, press the "MAIN MENU" button on the Startup Screen. This takes the operator to a screen where various machine settings, diagnostics, and process controls are available.
The Main Menu Screen presents multiple options for controlling the machine: Forming Sequences – Select and modify pre-programmed cycles. Oven Controls – Adjust heating zone temperatures. Clamp Frame & Platen Controls – Configure movement and pressure settings. Diagnostics & Alarms – View system errors and troubleshooting data. Manual Override – Adjust machine components manually. These options give operators full control over the thermoforming process.
The MAAC Thermo Former includes several pre-programmed forming sequences, including: Vacuum Forming – Standard vacuum-based sheet forming. Pressure Forming – Uses compressed air for more detailed part shaping. Plug Assist Forming – Incorporates a mechanical plug to assist material distribution. C-Flex Sequence – Specialized cycle for flexible forming conditions. These sequences allow the machine to handle different types of thermoforming applications.
The C-Flex sequence is used for precise control over material stretching and forming. It provides: Variable motion control for flexible molds. Optimized heating and cooling timing. Enhanced material distribution for complex part shapes. This mode ensures better forming results for parts with critical tolerances.
The system includes multiple timers for controlling different phases of the process. Typically, there are 8 to 16 independent timers to control: Heating time. Vacuum/pressure timing. Cooling delay. Ejector activation timing. These timers allow fine-tuned cycle control for high-quality parts.
The Global Compensation feature adjusts oven temperature settings based on ambient conditions. Automatically increases or decreases temperature to account for room temperature variations. Ensures consistent heating and prevents part defects caused by temperature fluctuations. This feature helps maintain process repeatability.
Always follow Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures before maintenance. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, safety glasses, hearing protection). Keep hands and body clear of moving parts (platens, clamp frames, and molds). Ensure the emergency stop (E-Stop) is functional before starting operation.
Never bypass safety interlocks or light curtains. Never disable emergency stop circuits. Never remove safety guards while the machine is running. Tampering with safety features increases the risk of injury and machine damage.
Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) is essential when: Performing maintenance on electrical or mechanical components. Changing molds or adjusting the platen assembly. Repairing or inspecting the heating system. Clearing jammed material inside the clamp frame. LOTO ensures the machine cannot be accidentally started during servicing.
Always use two hands when handling clamp frames to prevent dropping. Ensure clamps are properly locked before forming begins. Watch for pinch points—clamp frames can cause severe hand injuries. Proper handling ensures operator safety and consistent forming results.
Shut down the machine and follow LOTO procedures. Release all hydraulic and pneumatic pressure. Ensure the platen is fully retracted and stable. Use proper lifting equipment for heavy platen components. These precautions prevent accidental movement and injuries.
The main dangers include: Crushing injuries from platen movement. Burn hazards from heated molds. Pinch points where rotating parts meet. Entanglement risk if loose clothing gets caught. Operators must stay clear of moving parts and wear fitted clothing.
Heated surfaces (ovens, molds, platens) – Can cause burns. Moving parts (clamp frames, ejectors, rotary mechanisms) – Can cause pinch or crush injuries. Sharp edges (cutting stations, trim tools) – Can cause cuts or punctures. Being aware of these surfaces reduces injury risk and ensures safe operation.
Besides sheet quality, the most important factor in thermoforming is consistent and accurate temperature control. Even heating ensures uniform material distribution. Temperature control prevents defects like thinning, warping, or improper forming. Optimized heating zones reduce cycle time and improve part consistency. Without precise temperature control, variability in forming results increases, leading to higher scrap rates.
Profile heating is a method where different zones of the plastic sheet are heated at different intensities to optimize material flow. Benefits include: Better thickness distribution—prevents thin spots in deep-draw areas. Reduced stress on material—improves part durability. More efficient energy use—heats only where necessary. Minimizes warping and sagging—ensures high-quality finished parts. Profile heating is especially useful for forming complex geometries.
The recommended vacuum level for thermoforming is 27–29 inches of mercury (Hg) (91–98 kPa). Why? Ensures fast and uniform part forming. Reduces trapped air bubbles between the sheet and mold. Improves detail reproduction in high-precision molds. Stronger vacuum = faster cycle time and better part consistency. Vacuum levels below 27 inHg may lead to incomplete forming and poor definition.
Aluminum molds with temperature controls are recommended because they: Provide uniform cooling, reducing internal stresses. Have high thermal conductivity, shortening cycle times. Allow precise temperature adjustments, ensuring dimensional accuracy. Are lightweight yet durable, making them easy to handle and maintain. Temperature-controlled aluminum molds prevent defects like warping, sink marks, and shrinkage variations.
Temperature-controlled molds can have: Internal cooling channels for consistent part cooling. Vacuum ports for faster and more detailed forming. Textured surface finishes for aesthetic enhancements. Pressure-assist systems for higher-definition parts. These integrations improve quality, repeatability, and processing speed.
These materials are not recommended because they: Have poor heat transfer, leading to uneven cooling. Are less durable, wearing out faster than aluminum or steel. Absorb moisture, which can lead to mold degradation over time. Lack precision, causing part inconsistencies. For high-quality production, aluminum molds with temperature control are preferred.
Common serious thermoforming issues include: Poor thickness distribution – Results in weak, inconsistent parts. Warping and distortion – Caused by uneven cooling or excessive stress. Webbing – Occurs when material folds and traps air, ruining the part. Bubbles and splay – Due to excess moisture or overheating. Vacuum failure – Leads to incomplete forming and loss of detail. Poor trim fit – Parts do not fit properly in secondary assembly. Addressing these problems requires precise process control, mold quality, and material handling.
The typical gauge tolerance for extruded plastic sheets is ±5–10% of nominal thickness. For example: 0.250-inch sheet → ±0.0125 to 0.025 inches tolerance. 0.125-inch sheet → ±0.006 to 0.012 inches tolerance. Thicker sheets tend to have wider tolerances due to extrusion variability.
The best cooling method is uniform forced-air and water-cooled mold surfaces. Water-cooled molds provide rapid, controlled cooling. Even airflow prevents uneven shrinking or warping. Mist cooling can be used for delicate parts to avoid surface stress cracks. Proper cooling ensures consistent dimensions and prevents internal stresses.
Trimming parts at the same temperature ensures: Consistent dimensional accuracy—warmer parts may shrink after trimming. Reduced stress cracks—cold parts become brittle and prone to cracking. Better edge quality—ensures smooth cuts without burrs. For high-precision applications, trimming should be done within a controlled temperature range.
Parts must be trimmed at a uniform temperature when: Tight tolerances are required (e.g., medical or aerospace parts). Parts will be assembled later—variations cause misalignment. Multiple parts need to match in size (e.g., plastic enclosures). If parts cool at different rates, shrinkage variations will cause dimensional mismatch.
Trim handling is crucial because: Recycling trim reduces material costs (regrind can be reused). Poor handling leads to contamination, making regrind unusable. Optimized trim collection improves efficiency, reducing waste. Proper trim separation ensures material purity, maintaining quality. Companies save thousands of dollars annually through efficient trim recycling.
When the core of the plastic sheet is too cold, the material: Does not stretch evenly, causing thin spots. Forms internal stresses, leading to part warping. Does not conform properly to mold details. Cracks or breaks under pressure due to insufficient softening. For consistent forming, the core must reach the correct temperature before shaping.
A fast vacuum response is critical because: Prevents premature cooling before forming is complete. Captures fine mold details for higher precision. Minimizes material thinning, improving part strength. Increases production speed, reducing cycle times. Vacuum must be engaged immediately when the material contacts the mold.
The set temperature refers to the target temperature programmed into the oven controls to achieve proper material softening. Key factors affecting set temperature: Material type (PP, PET, ABS, PC, etc.). Sheet thickness (thicker sheets need higher set temperatures). Heating system efficiency (IR vs. convection). Correct set temperatures prevent overheating, degradation, and poor forming.
The lower processing limit refers to the minimum temperature at which a thermoplastic sheet can be properly formed. Typically 275°F to 320°F (135°C to 160°C), depending on material. Below this limit, the sheet: Does not stretch properly. Fails to conform to mold details. May crack or split during forming. Processing below this limit results in poor part quality and increased scrap.
Bi-axial orientation enhances: Material strength – Increased impact resistance. Dimensional stability – Reduces shrinkage after forming. Optical clarity – Improves light transmission for clear plastics (e.g., PET, PC). Better barrier properties – Useful in food packaging applications. This process stretches the plastic sheet in two directions during manufacturing, aligning molecular chains for better performance.
The normal forming temperature depends on the plastic type: Material Normal Forming Temperature (°F)(°C) Polypropylene (PP) 330–370°F 165–188°C Polyethylene (PE) 275–320°F 135–160°C Polystyrene (PS) 300–350°F 150–175°C Acrylic (PMMA) 350–420°F 175–215°C Polycarbonate (PC) 400–450°F 200–230°C These temperatures soften the sheet for proper forming without degradation.
The upper processing limit is the temperature beyond which the plastic starts degrading instead of forming properly. Typically 50–100°F (10–40°C) above the normal forming range. Exceeding this limit causes: Material decomposition (burning or charring). Gas bubbles and surface defects. Weakening of the polymer structure. For example, PC should not exceed 500°F (260°C), or ABS should not go above 430°F (220°C).
Each purchased material batch should include: Material certification sheet – Verifies resin type, molecular weight, and additives. Processing guidelines – Ensures proper heating, cooling, and forming conditions. Moisture content information – Determines if predrying is required. These documents help maintain consistency and prevent processing issues.
Up to 30% regrind is acceptable for general applications. Higher percentages may affect material flow and impact resistance. Medical or food-grade products typically prohibit regrind due to contamination risks. Using properly filtered and dried regrind prevents quality issues.
