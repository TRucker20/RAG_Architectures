The BOY 35 EVV is designed to process plastics, elastomers, silicones (liquid), thermoset plastics, or PVC. The documentation cautions against using other compounds, as they may damage the machine.
The standard plasticizing unit has five temperature control zones: three cylinder heating tape zones, a plinth heating tape zone, and a nozzle heating tape zone. The temperature of the cylinder heating tapes is monitored using bayonet-mounted plug-in type thermocouples.
The permitted operating temperatures are up to 300 °C for standard heating tapes, 400 °C for high-performance heating tapes, and 430 °C for the "EconPlast" plasticizing unit.
The Procan ALPHA 4 control displays cylinder temperature zones graphically and numerically. Temperatures are color-coded: blue indicates under-temperature, green indicates the temperature is within the working area, and red indicates over-temperature. The display range covers ±15 °C (± 27 °F) relative to the set-up value.
The manual recommends a "Water distributor with magnetic valve for intake zone" when using a plasticizing unit with a screw diameter of 12/14 mm, a vertical injection unit, or thermoplastic elastomers. A temperature probe monitors and controls the temperature in the feed throat area, ensuring uniform feeding.
For materials needing high mold temperatures, the manual recommends temperature conditioning via a thermal sensor and controller, referencing screen number 5.30.
The screw is blocked if the actual temperature of a heating zone is more than 15°C below its set-up value. This block is inactive if "Elastomer / Thermoset processing" is enabled on screen page "14.30".
PC (Polycarbonate) is only restrictively suitable for processing.
The procedure for barrel change requires safety gloves and a face guard when working on heated nozzles, barrels and screws. The user should also check the list of constants for compatibility.
Wear cannot be avoided, since it is a system property involving erosion of a material surface due to friction. Causes include raw material composition, blends, processing properties, pressures, filler style and quantity, color pigmentation, temperature control, dwell times, throughput rate, flow velocity, decomposition products, and media like oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and steam.
The open nozzle is suited for high viscous thermoplastics or materials sensitive to friction heat.
The BC nozzle is used to inject thermoplastics directly without any sprue.
Reinforced materials are suited for the mould gate nozzle with shut off mechanism.
After inputting data like projected area, material, wall thickness, flow path, and flow behavior characteristics, the necessary clamping pressure can be calculated by pressing the start key. The manual notes these calculated values are suggested and should be verified during the injection cycle.
Different materials require specific nozzles. For example, thermoset plastics require nozzles with a specific radius and screw diameter. Open nozzles are suitable for high viscous thermoplastics or materials sensitive to friction heat.
On the screen page "7.10 Production data", the material weight for a cycle can be entered, enabling calculation of material throughput.
The technical data includes screw retraction force, nozzle pressure force, and nozzle stroke. The optimal values of these depend on the material being used.
The maximum shot weight is calculated using the formula: max. shot weight = density ρM x theoretical stroke volume.
Classifications of wear include abrasive wear, flushing wear, erosion, corrosion, and pitting corrosion. These are influenced by the type and chemical composition of the raw material, the presence of fillers, and the processing conditions.
Ensure adequate lighting and ventilation at the machine location. Consult the plastic manufacturers' data sheets to understand if a plastic generates hazardous gases during processing.
The analytical parameters should remain within certain limits to maintain water quality. Polluted water should be filtered prior to use to protect the Y06T water valve.
Only mineral oil-based hydraulic fluids with highly active additives that do not affect lead-containing bearing materials should be used. The fluids must meet or exceed the requirements of VDMA 24318 and DIN 51524, part 2 for HLP hydraulic oils.
Use cleaning granulate and observe the manufacturers' recommendations, since these granulates depend on the type of plastic being processed.
The clamping unit forms the tool installation space and is used for the safe application of the tool traction power. The design of the tools influence any residual risks, and the user is responsible for safety.
Only specified plastics, elastomers, silicones (liquid), thermoset plastics, or PVC should be processed; other compounds may damage the machine. Incorrect loading of a list of constants leads to erroneous technical data, false settings, excessive injection pressures and damage to the moulding machine.
Only use approved materials, ensure staff are experienced, and that operators have received instruction on the machine and safety.
Technical data provides information on screw speeds, noting some differences depending on the motor being used.
The following analytical parameters should remain within the limits specified if water is used as the circulating medium in heat transfer systems: a pH between 6.5 and 8.5, a max of 150 mg/l for chloride, and a max of 250 mg/l for sulphate.
The data sheets provided by the plastic manufacturers will indicate which plastics generate hazardous gases during processing.
The formula to calculate the max shot weight is: max. shot weight = density ρM x theor. stroke volume.
PS, SB, SAN, ABS, PE, PP, PA only limited or materials with flame retardants.
The oil must be analyzed approx. every 5000 operating hours to determine whether the oil quality still complies with the HPL specification. The oil should be exchanged at least every 20,000 operating hours if an analysis report is not available.
The recommended predrying conditions for SAN (Luran) are 3 hours at 80°C, for ABS (Novodur W, Terluran) are 3 hours at 85°C.
The recommended processing data includes information on fluidity and back pressure.
The documentation lists different types of nozzles including NV (conditionally recommended), AC (shut off nozzle), BC (shut off nozzle), O (open nozzle), and VK (prechamber nozzle).
The documentation provides identification characteristics for thermoplastics, including melting points.
Identification characteristics for thermoplastics include whether they are opaque or transparent, their ability to be marred by a fingernail, breakage behavior (no fracture, white fracture, brittle fracture), burning behavior (sooting, clear flame, self-extinguishing), and vapor smell (candle wax, horn-like, styrene, pungent, fruity, phenole, tarry).
Wear and tear on the screw and barrel is affected by the type and chemical composition of the raw material, any raw material blends, and the properties of the raw material during processing.
The style and quantity of filler affect the wear of plasticizing units.
It is recommended that the mold temperature is controlled through a thermal sensor and an appropriate controller.
Cycle time is influenced by cooling time, and the speed at which this occurs is affected by the thermal conductivity of the material.
The recommended processing data includes mold temperatures for different materials.
This information is not present in the source text, but it is logical to say that the material's shrinkage is related to mold design and processing parameters.
For materials sensitive to friction heat, the open nozzle is suitable.
It is recommended to only use hard-to-draw-in materials in a pre-dried condition. This prevents bridging caused by moisture in the intake channel.
This information is not available in the source text.
This relates to the causes of wear, including the type and chemical composition of the raw material.
For the processing of so-called "transition thermoplastics" and "technical thermoplastics", the use of high wear resistant plasticising units is urgently recommended. For the processing of "heavy-duty thermoplastics", the use of high wear resistant plasticising units is essential.
The maximum water pressure is 10 bar.

NEVER, enter the operating area of the machine while the machine is in the automatic mode or while someone is within access of the controls without disabling the machine power10.
NEVER, attempt to circumvent the guarding of this machine, or operate this machine without its guards11.
NEVER, install tooling, clean, repair, or adjust this machine without being certain that all areas are clear, and that the power source is locked out11.
NEVER, install, repair, or load the clamp frames of this machine with your hands in the clamping area. When installing or repairing clamp frames release all air pressure prior to handling them11.
NEVER, perform maintenance on the platen assembly without blocking and supporting them. Be sure to remove all blocking before returning to operation11.
NEVER, place your hands or any other portion of your body in between the platens, molds or around any of the revolving mechanisms of the machine (i.e.: chain, gear rack sprockets and carousel)12.
ALWAYS, maintain an awareness level that corresponds with the operation of machinery. Also, remember that this machine is equipped with Ovens and contains HOT surfaces12.
Assuming the thermoformer has good sheet to work with, the next most important factor is its proper heating13.
Computer controlled multi-zoned ovens are now capable of profile heating which has the ability to produce a consistent sheet temperature from the perimeter to the center, reduces sag, uses less energy and decreases the heating and cooling cycle times13.
To attain stress free, top quality parts, very rapid vacuum is normally used. All vacuum systems should have a rated pressure of 29 inches of mercury (Hg)14.
To consistently achieve quality parts at an economical cost15.
Molds with cast-in cooling, machined cooling channels, and cooling pins or cooling plates must be used15.
They should be used only for very special projects and very short runs because otherwise, cost and quality suffer greatly15.
The most common serious problem encountered is sheet or film from extrusion runs in which resin, additives, and regrind are not consistently and thoroughly mixed, so that materials from the beginning, the middle, and the end of the runs are not identical16.
Typical gauge tolerance is plus or minus 5%, various colors accept heat differently and each compound can absorb varying amounts of moisture16.
Ideally, heat should be removed from both sides of the part at the same rate and in the same manner17.
Trimming parts at the same temperature each time helps tremendously in maintaining size tolerance18.
When close tolerances are required in the finished part, it is essential that it be trimmed at the same time and temperature after removal from the mold, or after all the post-shrinkage has occurred18.
Clean, uncontaminated trim that has not been degraded or allowed to gather dust makes far better sheet when recycled, resulting in fewer problems for the extruder and ultimately the thermo-former18.
When the core is below the processing temperature, excessive stresses may be created in the formed part, producing negative results such as warping and lower impact strength13.
Then the faster the vacuum, the better the material distribution, since it does not have time to cool as it is formed, This produces a minimum of internal stresses and parts with the best possible physical properties19.
The set temperature is the temperature at which the thermoplastic sheet hardens and can be safely de-molded20.
Lower processing limit is the lowest possible temperature for the sheet before it is completely formed. Parts formed at or below this limit will have severely increased internal stress; another reason for rapid vacuum or forming pressure20.
Properties such as impact and tensile strengths21.
Normal forming temperature is the temperature the core of the sheet must reach for proper forming under normal circumstances22.
Upper limit is the temperature at which the sheet begins to degrade or decompose. It is crucial that the sheet stay below this temperature22.
Any material purchased should be accompanied by written specifications to be reviewed with sheet and resin vendors23.
Do not use more than 45% regrind, if possible24.
