The experiments showed that the damping ratio increases with an increase in the excitation amplitude6.... This indicates that at higher excitation levels, more energy is dissipated.
The square tube exhibited a higher damping ratio compared to the circular tube6.... This is attributed to the square tube having more material near the edges, where stresses are higher, which enhances damping6.... The circular tube showed the lowest damping ratio because most of its material is located near the neutral axis, where bending stresses are minimal12.
Inherent damping in composites significantly contributes to the overall damping due to various energy dissipation mechanisms like interfacial slip, micro-cracking, dislocation, and phase boundary effects7. Enhancing inherent damping properties can be achieved through proper material selection, loading conditions, and optimizing the cross-section without adding extra weight15....
Composites are materials made up of two or more materials combined to create superior properties compared to the individual components3. They are used because they can achieve desired properties that are not possible with single-phase materials, and their properties can be altered by adding particles to the matrix3. These alterations enhance the resulting material’s functionality and performance3.
Poisson's ratio is the ratio of transverse contraction to longitudinal extension in a tensile test4. Most traditional materials have a positive Poisson's ratio, meaning they contract when stretched4. NPR materials, also known as auxetic materials, expand when stretched and contract when compressed, offering enhanced mechanical properties like fracture toughness and elastic modulus4.
NPR materials have found applications as impact absorbers, foams, composites, and textile material for military purposes5. They are also used in sports, biomedical, and aircraft industries5.
TPMS-based composites are composites characterized by three-dimensional interconnectivity and periodicity6. They divide space into two entwined regions, and the summation of principal curvatures at each point in these structures is zero6. TPMS composites possess superior properties compared to counterparts due to the interconnectivity of phases and evade stress concentrations common in truss and strut-based structures, allowing a smooth transfer of load, resulting in better integrity of the composite materials6.
The level-set approximation is a methodology used to generate the nodal coordinates that represent TPMS-based RVEs7. It is the simplest and most adopted approach for generation, using trigonometric equations where the function Ψ(x, y, z) represents the surface computed at an isovalue7. By plotting the level set to surface t = 0, the domain is divided into two subdomains with equal volumes and can be altered by changing the values of t8.
Existing micromechanical models, such as Voigt, Reuss, and Hashin-Shtrikman, do not fully account for the effects of the shape of inclusions (TPMS) and the Poisson's ratio, especially for negative values and higher volume fractions17. This leads to deviations in predicted effective properties compared to numerical results17. The mathematical expression given in Eq. (7), along with the constant values provided in Tables 1 and 2, can be useful to estimate the effective properties17.
Superior thermal transport properties are critical in several engineering applications, including: Electronic packaging design, where efficient thermal management is needed for the effective functionality of devices3. Design of protective helmets and body armor, where thermal comfort is essential for users in extreme environments3....
Conventional polymeric foams generally do not have desirable thermal transport properties due to their random micro and molecular structure5. They are also prone to issues like expansion, creep, melting, aging, degradation at high temperatures, and brittle fracture at low temperatures. In contrast, VACNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity, making them more suitable for applications requiring efficient heat transfer5....
The thermal diffusivity (α) of VACNTs decreases with an increase in temperature C7. This is because heat is primarily transported by phonons (lattice vibrations) in CNTs. As temperature increases, higher energy phonons increase phonon-phonon scattering, reducing the mean free path of the phonons and, consequently, lowering thermal diffusivity7.
The specific heat capacity (Cp) of VACNTs demonstrates a linear increase with increasing temperature8. This is mainly due to the contribution of phonons, specifically longitudinal (LA) and twisting (TW) phonon modes, which result in a linear dependency of Cp with temperature due to the constant phonon density of states arising from these modes8....
How does this compare to the relationship between thermal diffusivity and temperature? Answer: The effective thermal conductivity (keff) of VACNTs linearly increases with an increase in temperature, which is opposite to the temperature dependency of thermal diffusivity (α)10. This difference occurs because the increase of Cp with temperature is much steeper than the decrease in α11.
Intrinsic thermal conductivity (ki) is the thermal conductivity of the CNTs within the cylinder wall thickness, excluding the volume associated with the hollow and gap regions in the architected VACNTs12. It is calculated as ki = ραiCp, where ρi is the intrinsic density defined as ρ/Vf (ρ is the bulk density, and Vf is the fill fraction), α is the thermal diffusivity, and Cp is the specific heat capacity12.
Mesoscale architecture affects the thermal resistance of VACNTs such that architected samples exhibit higher effective thermal resistance (Reff) but lower intrinsic thermal resistance (Ri) compared to non-architected VACNT samples13. This is due to the higher intrinsic thermal conductivity (ki) in architected VACNTs13.
Mechanical preconditioning and strain recovery significantly impact the thermal diffusivity of VACNTs. The thermal diffusivity (α) exhibits a large initial decrease followed by a gradual decrease with consecutive compression cycles. Samples with higher strain recovery show a less pronounced decrease in α, indicating that lesser permanent morphology changes and nanoscale strain in CNTs lead to better thermal performance14....
VACNT foams demonstrate one to two orders of magnitude higher effective thermal conductivity (keff) compared to polymeric, metallic, and ceramic foams16. While metallic and ceramic foams may have higher keff, they also have much higher densities. VACNTs also exhibit a sub-linear scaling of keff with density, allowing for significant density reduction without significantly degrading keff16....
SCF is the ratio of the maximum stress at the hole edge to the nominal stress, while SNCF is the ratio of the maximum strain at the hole edge to the nominal strain1. These factors are crucial for the safe design of structures with holes, as they help engineers account for the increased stress and strain levels around these discontinuities1.
The stress and strain concentration factors are influenced by size, shape, and eccentricity of the hole, the number of plies, fiber orientation, and plate curvature2.
Stress concentration is maximum when the fibers are aligned in the loading direction and minimum when the fibers are aligned at 45∘ to the loading direction8.... For 0∘ and 90∘ fiber orientations, the maximum stress occurs at a circumferential angle of 90∘, while for 45∘ fiber orientation, the peak stress occurs around a 100∘ circumferential angle10.
As the size of the hole increases, the SCF and SNCF generally decrease11. The characteristic distance remains the same regardless of the hole size12. However, for a 45° fiber orientation, the trend is reversed13.
SCF increases with an increase in curvature for both isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical plates, but this increase is more pronounced in orthotropic plates, especially at higher curvatures14.
Both SCF and SNCF increase with an increase in eccentricity. When the hole is at zero eccentricity, the stress distribution around the hole edge is symmetrical. However, with an increase in the hole eccentricity, stress distribution is found to be unsymmetrical17.
The NExT-ERA (Natural Excitation Technique - Eigensystem Realization Algorithm) approach was used to evaluate the dynamic characteristics such as natural frequency, mode shape, and damping ratio of the system subjected to base excitation. This method involves estimating the power spectral density (PSD) matrix from acceleration data and using it to obtain the correlation matrix for dynamic properties evaluation.
Filling a tube with lightweight materials such as polymer foam improves the capability of absorption and dissipation of vibrational energy. Also, EPS foams have excellent strength to weight ratio and high energy dissipation efficiencies.
A desirable linear scaling (α, β ≈ 1) with density is a key characteristic because it ensures that specific mechanical properties remain constant even with decreasing density2. This is in contrast to inefficient higher-order density-dependent scaling, where a slight decrease in density can substantially degrade the strength and stiffness of the foam2....
At the atomic scale, the foams have a graphitic structure; at the nanoscale, they consist of tubular multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs); and at the microscale, they exhibit an entangled forest-like morphology of nearly vertically aligned MWCNTs4.
The architecture significantly influences the density-dependent scaling of properties like modulus, strength, and energy dissipation5. Different architectures result in different deformation mechanisms, enabling tailored mechanical performance at low densities5.
The key design parameters include the internal diameter of the innermost cylinder (Din), the wall thickness of the cylinders (t), the gap between the concentric cylinders (gcc), and the number of rings of concentric cylinders (n)6.
As the gap increases, the material becomes more compliant and exhibits a plateau-like region in the stress−strain response, accompanied by a sharp decay in bulk density7. The hypothesis is that smaller gaps lead to shell-buckling and local densification, while larger gaps result in column buckling and softening of the foam7.
Energy dissipation per unit volume (Wdis) is calculated by computing the area inscribed within the loading−unloading cycle of the stress−strain curves8. If WL is the area under the loading curve and WUL is the area under the unloading curve, then Wdis = WL - WUL8....
Intrinsic density (ρi) is a measure of the density of VACNT cylinders, excluding all the empty space in the architecture10.... It increases with gcc due to a rise in the number density of CNTs11. The fill-factor of the architecture balances the effect of increasing intrinsic density, giving a slow response for higher gcc11.
As Vf increases, both ρb and ρi converge toward the typical density range of nonarchitected VACNT foams12.... For smaller Vf, foams are lighter (less ρb) and tend to be softer, but they exhibit higher ρi, which counterbalances the effect to preserve mechanical properties14.
Damping capacity (δ) measures the percentage of total energy dissipated by a foam, while energy absorption efficiency (ψ) is the ratio of energy absorbed by a foam up to a particular strain to the energy absorbed by an equivalent ideal absorber15. As the deformation mode transitions from shell buckling to column buckling with higher gcc, there is a synergistic improvement in both damping capacity and EAE16....
Menger sponges are hierarchical structures with tunable mechanical and electrical properties1. They have applications in various fields, including the medical industry (dental and bone implants)1..., aerospace1..., industrial applications1..., computer chip cooling2, and building construction3.
The effect of cavity shape on the mechanical and electrical behavior of Menger sponges becomes noticeable when the effective density falls below 0.81. A square cavity leads to the maximum decrement in thermal and electrical conductivity, while a hexagonal cavity results in the least reduction1.
An increment in the order of fractals leads to a near-zero value for Poisson's ratio1. The structure becomes more resistant to deformation as the order of the Menger sponge increases4.
Menger sponges can be used in dental and bone implants due to their tunable mechanical properties and resemblance to human bone in terms of mechanical stiffness1.... The high porosity and fractal order of Menger sponges are also beneficial for bone regeneration13.
Menger sponge structures can be used to predict the thermal conductivity of building materials3.... By imitating porous materials, they can help in identifying the thermal insulation performance of buildings3....
Pores in polymer matrix composites can be a major limiting factor, influencing residual stress, damage initiation, matrix cracking, strength, and durability1. They act as potential sites for damage initiation and have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of the composite material2.
The shape, size, and distribution of pores are influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, resin property, and the fiber placement method, all of which are related to the specific manufacturing technique used3.
In the thermoset polymer manufacturing process, pores can be generated due to volume changes during curing (typically shrinkage), moisture absorbed in the resin during storage, dissolved gases in the resin, entrapped air and foreign material, evolution of gases during mixing, and formation of chemical volatiles during the curing reaction4.
In composites manufactured by autoclave processing, interlaminar pores can form due to air entrapment during fabric lay-up. Pores may also nucleate during the curing cycle due to the evaporation of volatiles or the release of gaseous by-products5. The formation of pores is alleviated by applying high pressure (3-8 atm) in the autoclave to attain a high fiber volume fraction5....
Liquid composite molding (LCM) involves infiltrating liquid resin into fibers. Air can be trapped during the resin flow, which is a primary cause of pore formation7. Non-uniform permeability in the fiber architecture leads to variations in resin flow velocity, resulting in air bubble entrapment7....
Pores can occur at various length scales: micro-pores within fiber tows, mesopores between tows, and macropores within the polymer or between different composite laminate layers7.
Pores can form due to the mechanical entrapment of air or via the nucleation process. Nuclei or mechanically entrapped pores may grow or dissolve through the diffusion of water vapor, air, or by agglomeration with surrounding pores, or due to increases in temperature and pressure9. The stability of a pore depends on the balance between internal pore pressure, external hydrostatic pressure, and surface tension at the polymer-pore interface9....
Thermoset polymers undergo volumetric change, commonly shrinkage, during the transformation from a liquid to a solid state during curing, which can lead to pore formation4.... Curing in a constrained mold can develop tensile stresses, exceeding the polymer's inherent strength and leading to the formation of pores12.
Temperature and pressure during autoclave-based curing are crucial parameters affecting pore content. Temperature initiates crosslinking between polymer chains, while optimized pressure removes entrapped air, water vapor, and excess resin, achieving low porosity13....
Under compression, VACNTs undergo collective sequentially progressive buckling, propagating from the low-density region to the high-density region4.... Upon unloading, they recover progressively4. This mechanism is important because it dissipates a larger portion of the absorbed strain energy during deformation8.
The compression-shear loading is performed in two stages9: Precompression: Two identical samples are placed symmetrically in a double shear apparatus, and a uniaxial precompression is applied9. Simple Shear Loading: The middle platen is moved vertically using a prescribed displacement to subject the VACNT foam samples to simple shear loading9.
The shear stress–strain response softens with an increase in initial precompression2. This is because the increase in initial precompression induces more collective sequential buckles in the VACNT samples, which later enable them to accommodate large shear strains through gradual unraveling of the buckles10.
The deformation mechanisms include11...: Rigid-body sliding: At low shear strains, the pristine region undergoes a rigid-body sliding-like motion on top of the buckled region without observable deformation in the pristine region11. Local shearing: At larger strain levels, the sliding diminishes, and the pristine region begins to shear locally with respect to the unraveled buckled region12.
Both the energy dissipation and the damping capacity in shear increase nonlinearly with initial precompression14. The ability of VACNT foams to dissipate higher energy in shear is particularly notable under large normal compressive loadings14.
Hierarchically architected materials offer the potential to overcome trade-offs between properties like modulus, strength, and specific energy absorption (SEA)1. They can provide synergistic enhancement in mechanical properties due to their multiscale origins, derived from structural features spanning nano to millimeter scales1. These materials can attenuate intense stress waves, absorb kinetic energy from impact, and provide thermally stable functionality, making them suitable for protective applications1.
A full-factorial DoE is a comprehensive multivariable study that reveals correlations between design variables2. It is more comprehensive than a one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) approach because it considers the effects of all variables and their inter connectivity2. ] 
The key geometrical parameters are the inner diameter of cylinders (Din), the thickness of cylinders (t), and the gap between the outer walls of neighboring cylinders (g)3. These parameters are varied and intermixed to create multiple samples for analysis3.
The hierarchical structure, with feature sizes ranging from angstroms to millimeters, allows VACNT foams to exhibit unique mechanical properties3. The multiwalled structure of individual CNTs at the nanoscale, their entangled forest-like morphology in the microscale, and their arrangement into vertically aligned bundles in the mesoscale enable them to undergo collective, sequentially progressive buckling under compressive loading3. This results in bulk strain recovery and superior thermal stability3.
Specific energy absorption (SEA) is one of the response variables (objectives) used to measure the performance of VACNT foams2. It is measured from the specific stress-strain hysteresis corresponding to cyclic compression up to 50% strain4. The energy dissipated is given by the hysteresis area enclosed by the loading-unloading curves5.
Intrinsic density (ρi) characterizes the mass density of CNTs within the cylinder wall region, excluding the volume associated with hollow and gap regions6. It is calculated by dividing the measured bulk density (ρb) by the fill factor of the cylindrical pattern6. Intrinsic density increases with decreasing thickness, signifying a size effect that influences the mechanical properties of the foam6.
Increased lateral interactions among adjacent mesoscale cylinders result in a dramatic increase in SEA at smaller gaps7. These interactions lead to an overall increment of specific stress due to the constrained deformation of individual cylinders7. The total amount of lateral interactions is proportional to the total cylindrical outer surface area7.
The D/t ratio is a dimensionless parameter commonly used to evaluate the load-carrying capacity of hollow cylindrical structures8. In common materials, SEA decreases with increasing D/t ratio8. However, in architected VACNT foams, the SEA stays almost constant with the D/t ratio when cylinders are tightly packed and undergoing lateral interactions8.
Architected VACNT foams outperform non-architected VACNT foams, polymeric foams, metallic foams, and other architected foams by exhibiting simultaneously improved SEA and specific modulus while being less dense11. They also achieve high specific compressive strength, enabling them to withstand loads without failure12.
