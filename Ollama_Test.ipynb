Data saved in the\\nmemory may become corrupted or lost due to system failure, repair,\\nmalfunction, bugs, or other causes.\\nPlease note that Toyota Motor Corporation takes no responsible\\nwhatsoever for direct and/or indirect damage, and offers no compen-\\nsation for data if the data that was saved in the internal memory\\ncould not be saved properly.\\nRemoval of the 12-volt battery\\nWhen the engine switch <power switch> is turned off, all data is\\nsaved in the system. If the 12-volt battery terminal is removed before\\nthe data is saved, the data may not be saved correctly.\\nIntroduction\\n9\\nSafety instructions\\nTo use this system in the safest possible manner, follow all the\\nsafety tips shown below.\\nThis system is intended to assist in reaching the destination and,\\nif used properly, can do so. The driver is solely responsible for the\\nsafe operation of the vehicle and the safety of your passengers.\\nDo not use any feature of this system to the extent it becomes a\\ndistraction and prevents safe driving. The first priority while driving\\nshould always be the safe operation of the vehicle. While driving,\\nbe sure to observe all traffic regulations. If a traffic sign on the\\nroad has been changed, route guidance may not have the updated\\ninformation such as the direction of a one way street.\\nWhile driving, listen to the voice instructions as much as possible\\nand glance at the screen briefly and only when it is safe. However,\\ndo not totally rely on voice guidance. Use it just for reference. If the\\nsystem cannot determine the current position correctly, there is a\\npossibility of incorrect or delayed guidance, or no voice guidance at\\nall.\\nThe data in the system may occasionally be incomplete. Road con-\\nditions, including driving restrictions (no left turns, street closures,\\netc.) frequently change. Therefore, before following any instructions\\nfrom the system, look to see whether the instruction can be done\\nsafely and legally.\\nThis system cannot warn about such things as the safety of an\\narea, condition of streets, and availability of emergency services.If\\nunsure about the safety of an area, do not drive into it. Under no\\ncircumstances is this system a substitute for the driver’s personal\\njudgement.\\nWARNING\\n●For safety, the driver should not operate the system while he/she is\\ndriving. Insufficient attention to the road and traffic may cause an acci-\\ndent.\\n●While driving, be sure to obey the traffic regulations and maintain\\nawareness of the road conditions.\\nIntroduction\\n10\\nReading this manual\\nExplains symbols used in this manual.\\nSymbols in this manual\\nSymbols\\nMeanings\\nWARNING :  Explains something that, if not obeyed, could\\ncause death or serious injury to people.\\nNOTICE :  Explains something that, if not obeyed, could\\ncause damage to or a malfunction in the vehicle or its\\nequipment.\\nIndicates operating or working procedures.\\nINFORMATION :  Explains something other than descrip-\\ntions about operation methods and functions that you\\nshould know and are useful to know.\\nSymbols in illustrations\\nSymbols\\nMeanings\\nIndicates the action (pushing, turning, etc.) used to operate but-\\ntons and other devices.\\nIntroduction\\n11\\nSymbols\\nMeanings\\nIndicates the component or place being explained.\\nIntroduction\\n12\\nPictorial index\\nInstrument panel\\nA Microphone ..............................................................................P.38\\nB Steering wheel switches\\nControlling audio............................................................P.33,34,159\\nUsing the Intelligent Assistant system .......................................P.39\\nMaking a phone call.................................................................P.194\\nC Display......................................................................................P.16\\nD USB port ...................................................................................P.35\\nIntroduction\\n13\\nIntroduction\\n14\\n1\\nBasic operation\\n1-1.

Toyota parking assist monitor\\n241\\n8\\nParking assist system\\nCleaning the camera\\nIf dirt or foreign matter, such as water droplets, snow, or mud, has\\nstuck to the camera, you will not be able to see the image clearly. If\\nthat happens, splash the camera with a large amount of water and\\nthen wipe the camera lens clean with a soft, damp cloth.\\nNOTICE\\n●The Toyota parking assist monitor may stop functioning correctly. Take\\nnote of the following items:\\n• Do not hit or apply a forceful impact on the camera. Doing so may\\nchange the position and mounting angle of the camera.\\n• The camera is designed to be waterproof. Do not detach, disassem-\\nble, or modify it.\\n• When washing the camera lens, splash the camera with a large\\namount of water and then wipe the camera lens clean with a soft,\\ndamp cloth. Rubbing the camera lens forcibly may scratch the cam-\\nera lens and images may no longer be able to be seen clearly.\\n• The camera cover is made of resin. Do not allow an organic solvent,\\ncar wax, window cleaner, or glass coating to adhere to the camera. If\\nthis happens, wipe it off immediately.\\n• Do not pour hot water on the vehicle in cold weather or apply other\\nrapid changes of temperature.\\n• If you wash the vehicle with a high pressure car washer, do not\\npoint the hose directly at the camera or camera area. Applying strong\\nwater pressure may result in the camera malfunctioning.\\n●If the camera is hit, it may cause a camera malfunction. If this happens,\\nhave the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer as soon as possible.\\n■Cleaning the rear camera with washer fluid\\nDirt on the rear camera lens can be cleaned by operating the\\ndedicated camera cleaning washer. For details, refer to \"OWNER’S\\nMANUAL\".\\n●When cleaning the camera, it may be difficult to see the image\\ndue to the washer fluid. When backing up, be sure to visually\\ncheck all around the vehicle both directly and using the mirrors\\nbefore proceeding.\\n8-1. Toyota parking assist monitor\\n242\\n●If washer fluid remains on the camera lens surface after cleaning,\\nthe image may be difficult to see at night due to the height or\\ninclination of the headlights of the vehicle behind.\\n●Some dirts may not be removed completely after cleaning. In this\\ncase, rinse the camera lens with a large quantity of water and then\\nwipe it clean with a soft cloth dampened with water.\\n●Washer fluid is sprayed onto the camera lens surface. Therefore,\\nthe ice, snow, etc. adhering around the camera cannot be re-\\nmoved.\\nNOTICE\\nDo not strike or hit the washer nozzle or subject it to a strong impact, as\\nthe washer nozzle installation position and angle may be changed.\\nDifferences between the screen and the actual road\\n●The distance guide lines and the vehicle width guide lines may\\nnot actually be parallel with the dividing lines of the parking space,\\neven when they appear to be so. Be sure to check visually.\\n●The distances between the vehicle width guide lines and the left\\nand right dividing lines of the parking space may not be equal,\\neven when they appear to be so. Be sure to check visually.\\n●The distance guide lines show a distance guide for flat road surfa-\\nces.

Using \\nboth a camera and front radar, PCS w/ PD can provide an audio/visual alert to \\nwarn you of a possible collision under certain circumstances. If you don’t react, the \\nsystem is designed to automatically brake.\\nAs there is a limit to the degree of recognition accuracy and control performance \\nthat this system can provide, do not overly rely on this system. This system will not \\nprevent collisions or lessen collision damage or injury in every situation. Do not use \\nPCS instead of normal braking operations under any circumstances. Do not attempt \\nto test the operation of the Pre-Collision System yourself, as the system may not \\noperate or engage, possibly leading to an accident. In some situations, such as \\nwhen driving in inclement weather such as heavy rain, fog, snow or a sandstorm or \\nwhile driving on a curve and for a few seconds after driving on a curve, a vehicle, \\nbicyclist, pedestrian or motorcyclist may not be detected by the radar and camera \\nsensors, preventing the system from operating or engaging properly.\\nRefer to the Toyota “Owner’s Manual” for a list of additional situations in which the \\nsystem operation may be limited.\\nPre-Collision Warning\\nWhen the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision is high, a \\nbuzzer will sound and an icon and warning message will be displayed on the Multi-\\nInformation Display (MID) to urge the driver to take evasive action.\\nPre-Collision Brake Assist\\nIf the driver notices the hazard and brakes, the system may provide additional \\nbraking force using Brake Assist. This system may prime the brakes and may apply \\ngreater braking force in relation to how strongly the brake pedal is depressed.\\nPre-Collision Brake Control\\nIf the driver does not brake in a set time and the system determines that the \\npossibility of a collision with a preceding vehicle is extremely high, the system may \\nautomatically apply the brakes, reducing speed in order to help the driver reduce \\nthe impact and in certain cases avoid the collision.\\nSee www.toyota.com/safety-sense for more information.\\n59\\nMonocular camera sensor\\nMillimeter\\nwave radar\\nAs part of the Pre-Collision System, this function is also designed to first provide an \\nalert and then automatic braking if needed.\\nRefer to the Toyota “Owner’s Manual” for additional limitations and information.\\nUnder certain conditions, the PCS included with TSS 3.0 may also help to detect a \\npedestrian, bicyclist or motorcyclist in front of your vehicle using the forward-facing \\ncamera and the front radar sensor. The forward-facing camera of PCS detects a \\npotential pedestrian, bicyclist or motorcyclist based on size, profile, and motion of \\nthe detected pedestrian, bicyclist or motorcyclist. However, a pedestrian, bicyclist \\nor motorcyclist may not be detected depending on the conditions, including the \\nsurrounding brightness and the motion, posture, size, and angle of the potential \\ndetected pedestrian, bicyclist or motorcyclist, preventing the system from operating \\nor engaging. \\nPCS PEDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nCHANGING PCS WARNING TIMING\\n(1) Press “\\n” or “\\n” switches and select “\\n” from the Multi-Information Display \\n(MID). \\n(2) Press “\\n” or “\\n” switches and select “\\n PCS” and then press and hold  \\n“\\n.” The setting screen is displayed.\\n(3) Press “\\n” or “\\n” switches and select “Warning timing” and then press “\\n”  \\nto change the desired setting.

Pulsing releases \\nbrake pressure repeatedly for fractions of a second. This helps the tires attain the \\ntraction that current road conditions will allow, helping you to stay in directional \\ncontrol.\\nBRAKE ASSIST (BA)\\nBrake Assist is designed to detect sudden or “panic” braking, and then add braking \\npressure to help decrease the vehicle’s stopping distance. When there’s only a split \\nsecond to react, Brake Assist can add additional brake pressure more quickly than \\njust the driver alone can.\\nELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION (EBD)\\nToyota’s ABS technology has Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) to help \\nmaintain control and balance when braking. EBD responds to sudden stops by \\nredistributing brake force to enhance the braking effectiveness of all four wheels.\\nSMART STOP TECHNOLOGY (SST)\\nSmart Stop Technology automatically reduces engine power when the accelerator \\nand brake pedals are pressed simultaneously under certain conditions. \\nSST engages when the accelerator is depressed first and the brakes are applied \\nfirmly for longer than one-half second at speeds greater than five miles per hour.  \\nSST doesn’t engage if the brake pedal is depressed before the accelerator pedal, \\nallowing vehicles to start on a steep hill and safely accelerate without rolling \\nbackward.\\nENHANCED VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL (VSC)\\nEnhanced Vehicle Stability Control provides cooperative control of the ABS, TRAC, \\nVSC and EPS.\\nEnhanced VSC helps to maintain directional stability when loss of traction occurs \\nduring a turn.\\nSAFETY & EMERGENCY FEATURES\\n81\\nOVERVIEW\\nFEATURES & OPERATIONS\\nTOYOTA SAFETY SENSE\\nSAFETY & EMERGENCY FEATURES\\nFloor mat installation\\nThere are two types of Toyota floor mats: carpeted and all-weather. Each vehicle \\nhas model-specific floor mats. Installation is easy. \\nTo keep your floor mat properly positioned, follow these steps:\\n•\\t Only use Toyota floor mats designed for your specific model.\\n•\\t Only use one floor mat at a time, using the equipped fasteners to keep the mat in \\nplace.\\n•\\t Install floor mats right side up. \\nAlways align the Δ marks\\nTRACTION CONTROL (TRAC)\\nVSC helps prevent loss of traction during cornering by reducing engine power, and \\nTraction Control helps maintain traction on loose gravel and wet, icy, or uneven \\nsurfaces by applying brake force to the spinning wheel(s). \\nToyota’s TRAC sensors are activated when one of the drive wheels starts to slip. \\nTRAC limits engine output and applies the brakes to the spinning wheel. This \\ntransfers power to the wheels that still have traction to help keep you on track.\\n82\\nDo not attempt the process while driving.\\nGETTING STARTED WITH  \\nTOYOTA AUDIO MULTIMEDIA \\nAND CONNECTED SERVICES\\nRegistering Your Vehicle\\nToyota app\\nBluetooth® Pairing\\nConnected Services\\nApple CarPlay®\\nAndroid Auto™\\nSiriusXM®\\nOnline Support Tool\\nUpdating System Software\\nScan QR Code to Download Toyota app\\nApple\\nAndroid\\n83\\nSTEP\\n6\\nSTEP\\n2\\nSTEP\\n1\\nRegistering Your Vehicle\\nDownload and open the Toyota \\napp on your device and follow \\ninstructions to add your vehicle \\nby scanning the QR Code \\ndisplayed on your vehicle’s \\nscreen.
